A two-part web app to document culinary experiences

## Project Abstraction

This project seeks to create a fully-functioning web app that documents culinary experiences. The app consists of an aesthetically-designed front-end constructed from React and Material UI and a Next.js back-end that saves entries via Firebase. The web directory will initially consist of a landing page that renders a search bar with different filtering options as well as a table that retrieves the 10 most recent entries with page navigation at its footer. Opening an entry should direct the user to a unique page that lists information related to the entry, including but not limited to name, country of origin, date(s) experienced, whether the item was cooked or dined, pictures of the dish, recipe log of the dish, etc.

## Front-end Abstraction

The front-end portion of the project will start off with a basic input bar that records its text content into a table ie similar to a "task tracker" app. Once basic functionality has been established, user input will be expanded to include multiple item properties.

At this point, development of page functionality will depend on back-end integration due to the need for data preservation. The app will be uploaded to Firebase in order to implement a back-end and database.

Design will be on the backburner for the majority of the project. Once baseline functionality of the app has been achieved, focus can be diverted to improving the CSS through SCSS and Bootstrap.

Practice on atomic committing and appropriate commenting will be practiced throughout this project in order to simulate a real-world developer environment.
